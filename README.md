I'm Dmitrii Okunev, and I waive my rights to any contributions to any [opensource](https://opensource.org/licenses/) project I made before 20th of October of 2023.

It means you can freely interpret my contributions as CC-0, unless they are made from domains "@mephi.ru", "@wisebits.com", "@fb.com" and "@meta.com". These domains are excluded from the waiver because I was paid for that work by other companies and I'm not sure I can unilateraly declare those contributions CC-0 without confirmation from those companies.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an Issue.
